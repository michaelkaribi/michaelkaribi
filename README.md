## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a mechanical engineering graduate from Australia, but my true passion lies in software development. Currently, I'm diving into JavaScript and honing my skills by building projects and working through exercises. Follow along as I document my learning journeyâ€”any feedback or collaboration is always welcome! ðŸš€
